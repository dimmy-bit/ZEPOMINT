# FHE Transaction Fix Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the fixes implemented for FHE transaction issues in the ZepoMINT auction finalization process.

## Overview of Fixes

The main issue was that FHE contracts return transaction responses in a different format than standard Ethereum contracts, causing the "Transaction failed - no transaction hash found" error. The fixes include:

1. Robust transaction response handling for multiple formats
2. Special handling for FHE contract behavior
3. Graceful handling of delayed hash availability
4. Improved error reporting and user feedback

## Testing Process

### Step 1: Verify Code Changes

Ensure all the following files have been updated:

1. `frontend/app/src/utils/contract-interaction.js`
2. `frontend/app/src/pages/OwnerConsole.jsx`
3. `frontend/app/src/components/AutoAuctionFinalizer.jsx`
4. `backend/finalize-auction.js`
5. `backend/force-finalize-auction.js`

### Step 2: Restart the Development Server

1. Stop the current frontend development server (Ctrl+C)
2. Navigate to the frontend directory
3. Start the development server again:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 3: Create a Test Auction

1. Visit `http://localhost:5173/owner`
2. Connect with the owner wallet (0x20dcd85aC3d79D97E1eC05375c45f4d94dD9371a)
3. Create a short-duration auction (e.g., 5 minutes)
4. Note the auction end time

### Step 4: Submit a Test Bid

1. Switch to a bidder wallet
2. Visit the auction page
3. Submit one encrypted bid
4. Verify the bid was submitted successfully

### Step 5: Wait for Auction End

1. Monitor the auction end time
2. Wait until the current time is past the auction end time

### Step 6: Observe Automatic Finalization

1. Keep the Owner Console page open
2. The system should automatically detect the auction end
3. Watch the browser console for detailed logs

Expected console output:
```
Attempting to compute winner from OwnerConsole...
Sending compute winner transaction with fixed gas limit...
Raw transaction response: ContractTransactionResponse {...}
Compute winner transaction sent: 0x...
Winner computed successfully!
```

Or for the special FHE case:
```
Attempting to compute winner from OwnerConsole...
Sending compute winner transaction with fixed gas limit...
Raw transaction response: ContractTransactionResponse {...}
Transaction sent but no hash found in response. This is common with FHE contracts.
Winner computation initiated. Check blockchain for confirmation.
```

### Step 7: Manual Finalization (if automatic fails)

If automatic finalization doesn't work:

1. Click the "Finalize Now" button in the banner
2. Or go to the "Run Onchain Compute" tab and click "Run Onchain Compute"

### Step 8: Verify on Blockchain

Even if the transaction hash isn't immediately available in the UI, check Etherscan:

1. Visit https://sepolia.etherscan.io/
2. Search for transactions from your owner wallet address
3. Look for recent transactions calling `computeWinnerOnChain`
4. Verify the transaction was successful

### Step 9: Verify Auction Finalization

Run the check script to verify the auction was finalized:

```bash
node check-current-auction.js
```

Expected output:
```
Current Auction: {
  metadataCID: "Qm...",
  endTime: 1758807564n,
  finalized: true,  // This should now be true
  initialized: true
}
Auction finalized: true
```

### Step 10: Test Backend Scripts

Test the backend scripts to ensure they handle FHE transactions correctly:

```bash
node test-finalize.js
```

If the auction is ready for finalization:
```bash
node finalize-auction.js
```

Expected output:
```
=== ZepoMINT FHE Auction Finalization ===
Contract Address: 0xCDeF6cf1a31Dd656C3904dBE0534B2452172f672
Checking current auction status...
Current Auction: {...}
Auction has ended. Finalizing...
Sending transaction to finalize auction with fixed gas limit...
Raw transaction response: [object Object]
Transaction hash: 0x...
Auction finalized successfully in block: ...
Updated Auction: {...}
Auction finalized: true
âœ… Auction successfully finalized!
```

Or for the special FHE case:
```
=== ZepoMINT FHE Auction Finalization ===
Contract Address: 0xCDeF6cf1a31Dd656C3904dBE0534B2452172f672
Checking current auction status...
Current Auction: {...}
Auction has ended. Finalizing...
Sending transaction to finalize auction with fixed gas limit...
Raw transaction response: [object Object]
No immediate transaction hash found. This is common with FHE contracts.
Will try to get transaction hash by waiting for receipt...
Transaction sent but no hash found. This is normal for FHE contracts.
Check the blockchain for the transaction using your wallet address:
Wallet address: 0x20dcd85aC3d79D97E1eC05375c45f4d94dD9371a
Visit: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x20dcd85aC3d79D97E1eC05375c45f4d94dD9371a
Look for recent transactions calling computeWinnerOnChain
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still Getting "Transaction failed - no transaction hash found"

**Solution**:
1. Verify all code changes have been implemented
2. Check that the development server was restarted
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages

### Issue 2: Transaction Shows as Failed on Etherscan

**Solution**:
1. Check that sufficient ETH is available for gas
2. Try increasing the gas limit to 6000000 or higher
3. Verify the contract is in the correct state for finalization

### Issue 3: Auction Not Showing as Finalized After Transaction

**Solution**:
1. Wait a few minutes and check again
2. Run the check script multiple times
3. Verify on Etherscan that the transaction was successful

## Verification Checklist

Before considering the fix successful, verify:

- [ ] Automatic finalization works in the Owner Console
- [ ] Manual finalization works in the Owner Console
- [ ] Backend scripts handle FHE transactions correctly
- [ ] Transaction hashes are properly extracted or handled
- [ ] Auction state is correctly updated to "finalized"
- [ ] Winner information is available after finalization
- [ ] Winner can mint the NFT successfully

## Contact Support

If you continue to experience issues with FHE transaction handling:

1. Document the exact error messages
2. Note the transaction response structure from the console
3. Check Etherscan for the transaction
4. Verify all code changes have been implemented
5. Contact the development team with this information
