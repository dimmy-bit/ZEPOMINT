# ZepoMint Security Documentation

This document outlines the security considerations, audit checklist, and best practices for the ZepoMint NFT auction platform.

## Security Architecture Overview

ZepoMint implements a multi-layered security approach:

1. **Application Layer Security**: Smart contracts with access controls and validation
2. **Encryption Layer Security**: Zama's fhEVM for fully homomorphic encryption
3. **Key Management Security**: Threshold KMS for distributed key management
4. **Network Layer Security**: Secure communication protocols
5. **Infrastructure Security**: CI/CD with security scanning

## Security Features

### 1. Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
- All bid values are encrypted using Zama's fhEVM v0.8
- No plaintext values are ever stored or transmitted
- On-chain comparisons happen entirely on encrypted data
- Winner determination without revealing bid amounts

### 2. Threshold Key Management System (TKMS)
- Distributed private key shares among N operator nodes
- Threshold t (t â‰¤ N) required for decryption operations
- Key rotation capabilities for enhanced security
- Audit logging for all key operations

### 3. Access Controls
- Owner-only functions for critical operations
- Bidder authentication through wallet signatures
- Permissioned access to sensitive contract functions
- Event logging for all critical operations

### 4. Input Validation
- Strict validation of all user inputs
- Protection against replay attacks with ZKPoKs
- Gas limit protections to prevent DoS attacks
- HCU (Homomorphic Complexity Unit) monitoring

## Audit Checklist

Before mainnet deployment, the following items must be verified:

### Smart Contract Security
- [ ] **Third-party Audits**: Conducted by Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, or Certora
- [ ] **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proof of contract correctness
- [ ] **Threat Modeling**: Comprehensive analysis of attack surfaces
- [ ] **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attacks to identify vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Fuzz Testing**: Automated testing with random inputs
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning for vulnerabilities

### FHE Implementation Security
- [ ] **Encryption Validation**: Verify correct implementation of FHE operations
- [ ] **Key Management Security**: Validate threshold KMS implementation
- [ ] **Zero-Knowledge Proof Security**: Verify ZKPoK implementation
- [ ] **Randomness Security**: Ensure cryptographically secure randomness
- [ ] **Side-Channel Attack Protection**: Protection against timing and power analysis

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] **CI/CD Security**: Secure deployment pipeline with signed commits
- [ ] **Dependency Security**: Regular scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] **Network Security**: Secure communication between components
- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerting**: Real-time security incident detection
- [ ] **Backup and Recovery**: Secure backup procedures and disaster recovery

### Operational Security
- [ ] **Key Management Procedures**: Secure key generation, storage, and rotation
- [ ] **Access Control Policies**: Least privilege principles for all systems
- [ ] **Incident Response Plan**: Procedures for handling security incidents
- [ ] **Security Training**: Regular training for development team
- [ ] **Bug Bounty Program**: Public program for vulnerability disclosure

## Compliance Considerations

### Privacy Regulations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data minimization and user rights
- **CCPA Compliance**: California Consumer Privacy Act requirements
- **PIPEDA Compliance**: Canadian privacy legislation

### Financial Regulations
- **AML/KYC**: Anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures
- **Securities Law**: Compliance with token sale regulations
- **Tax Reporting**: Automatic generation of tax documents

## Best Practices

### Development Practices
1. **Code Reviews**: All changes reviewed by senior developers
2. **Security Testing**: Automated and manual security testing
3. **Version Control**: Signed commits and protected branches
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive security documentation
5. **Incident Response**: Established procedures for security incidents

### Deployment Practices
1. **Staged Rollouts**: Gradual deployment to production
2. **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of all systems
3. **Backups**: Regular backups of all critical data
4. **Disaster Recovery**: Tested recovery procedures
5. **Security Updates**: Regular updates to all components

### Operational Practices
1. **Access Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all access
2. **Audit Trails**: Immutable logs of all critical operations
3. **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of all cryptographic keys
4. **Security Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for threats
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Regular compliance status reports

## Incident Response Plan

### Detection
- Real-time monitoring of contract events
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Automated alerts for suspicious activities

### Containment
- Emergency pause functionality
- Circuit breaker patterns for critical functions
- Immediate isolation of affected components

### Eradication
- Root cause analysis of security incidents
- Patch development and testing
- Verification of fixes before deployment

### Recovery
- Restoration from secure backups
- Validation of system integrity
- Gradual return to normal operations

### Lessons Learned
- Post-incident analysis and documentation
- Updates to security procedures
- Team training on incident response

## Conclusion

ZepoMint implements comprehensive security measures to protect user funds and privacy. The combination of FHE, threshold cryptography, and traditional security best practices creates a robust security posture. However, security is an ongoing process that requires continuous vigilance and improvement.
