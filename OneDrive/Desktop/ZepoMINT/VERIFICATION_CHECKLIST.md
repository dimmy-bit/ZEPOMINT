- [ ] Clear messages when wallet can't sign transactions

### [ ] 2. Transaction Errors
- [ ] Better handling of FHE transaction responses
- [ ] Graceful handling of delayed transaction hashes
- [ ] Clear error messages for gas estimation issues

### [ ] 3. User Experience
- [ ] Helpful error messages
- [ ] Clear success indicators
- [ ] Etherscan links for transaction verification

## Documentation Verification

### [ ] 1. Updated Documentation
- [ ] `HOW_IT_WORKS.md` reflects manual finalization

- [ ] `FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` summarizes all changes

## Final Testing Steps

### [ ] 1. Complete Flow Test
1. [ ] Create auction with owner wallet
2. [ ] Submit multiple bids from different wallets
3. [ ] Wait for auction to end
4. [ ] Manually finalize auction from owner console
5. [ ] Verify winner determination
6. [ ] Winner mints NFT successfully

### [ ] 2. Error Condition Testing
1. [ ] Try to finalize without wallet connection
2. [ ] Try to finalize with wrong wallet
3. [ ] Try to finalize before auction ends
4. [ ] Try to finalize already finalized auction

### [ ] 3. Edge Case Testing
1. [ ] Test with single bid
2. [ ] Test with multiple bids of same amount
3. [ ] Test with very high gas requirements
4. [ ] Test network connectivity issues

## Success Criteria

Before considering the implementation complete, verify that:

- [ ] No "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'getTransactionReceipt')" errors
- [ ] Manual finalization works reliably
- [ ] Winner is correctly determined using FHE operations
- [ ] Winner can mint NFT successfully
- [ ] All documentation is accurate and up-to-date
