## Current Status

There is an active auction that ends at: **2025-09-13T07:47:24.000Z** (in ~13 minutes)

## System Architecture

### Roles

1. **Owner (Admin)**: You (0x908bcf0d643e91fDA70a67A90580BBd121072a74)
   - Create auctions
   - Compute winners
   - Manage system

2. **Users (Bidders)**
   - Place encrypted bids
   - View auction status
   - Mint NFTs (if they win)

### Pages

1. **Home** (`/`) - Welcome page
2. **Auctions** (`/auctions`) - View active auctions and place bids
3. **Mint** (`/mint`) - Create new auctions (owner only)
4. **Owner Console** (`/owner`) - Admin functions (owner only)
5. **Docs** (`/docs`) - Documentation
6. **Wallet Test** (`/wallet-test`) - Wallet testing

## Complete Workflow Instructions

### Phase 1: Current Auction Finalization

1. **Navigate to Owner Console**
   - Go to `/owner`
   - Connect your wallet (must be the owner address)

2. **Finalize Current Auction**
   - Go to "Run Onchain Compute" tab
   - Click "Run Onchain Compute"
   - Wait for transaction confirmation

### Phase 2: Create New Auction

1. **Navigate to Mint Page**
   - Go to `/mint`
   - Connect your wallet (must be the owner address)

2. **Create Auction**
   - Fill in auction details
   - Click "Create Auction"
   - Wait for transaction confirmation

### Phase 3: Bidding

1. **Navigate to Auctions Page**
   - Go to `/auctions`
   - Connect any wallet

2. **Place Bid**
   - Enter bid amount
   - Click "Place Bid"
   - Wait for transaction confirmation
   - Your bid is encrypted before submission

### Phase 4: Winner Selection

1. **Wait for Auction to End**
   - Auction automatically ends after the specified duration

2. **Compute Winner**
   - Navigate to Owner Console (`/owner`)
   - Connect owner wallet
   - Go to "Run Onchain Compute" tab
   - Click "Run Onchain Compute"

### Phase 5: NFT Minting

1. **Winner Mints NFT**
   - Winner connects their wallet
   - Owner navigates to Owner Console
   - Goes to "Finalize & Mint" tab
   - Clicks "Finalize Auction & Mint NFT"

## Technical Implementation Details

### FHE Operations

All encryption and comparison operations use Zama FHE:

1. **Bid Encryption**: `fhevmjs` library encrypts bid values
2. **Bid Comparison**: `FHE.gt()` compares encrypted bids
3. **Winner Tracking**: `FHE.select()` tracks highest bidder
4. **Max Tracking**: `FHE.max()` tracks highest bid value

### Security Features

1. **Privacy**: All bids are encrypted, no plaintext values stored
2. **Access Control**: Only owner can create auctions and compute winners
3. **Permission Management**: Proper FHE permission grants for operations
4. **Tamper Resistance**: FHE operations ensure no manipulation

### Error Handling

1. **Auction Creation**: Prevents creating new auction while previous is active
2. **Bidding**: Only allows bids during active auction period
3. **Winner Computation**: Only after auction end time
4. **NFT Minting**: Only by winner after finalization

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Previous auction not finalized" Error

**Cause**: Trying to create new auction while previous is still active
**Solution**: 
1. Navigate to Owner Console (`/owner`)
2. Finalize current auction using "Run Onchain Compute"
3. Then create new auction

### "The Hardhat Fhevm plugin is not initialized" Error

**Cause**: Development environment plugin initialization issue
**Solution**: 
- This is a development tool issue, not a contract issue
- The contract operations work correctly
- Use the frontend UI for all interactions

### FHE Encryption Issues

**Cause**: Network or configuration issues
**Solution**:
- Ensure wallet is connected to Sepolia network
- Check that FHE instance is properly created
- Verify encryption completes before submission

## Testing the Complete Flow

### Test Script

You can use the provided test script to check the workflow:

```bash
node backend/scripts/complete-workflow-test.js

1. Check current auction status
2. Provide instructions for next steps
3. Help you test the complete workflow

### Manual Testing

1. **Create Auction** (Owner)
   - Navigate to `/mint`
   - Fill details and submit
   - Verify transaction success

2. **Place Bid** (User)
   - Navigate to `/auctions`
   - Enter bid amount
   - Verify encrypted submission

3. **Compute Winner** (Owner)
   - Navigate to `/owner`
   - Run onchain compute
   - Verify winner selection

4. **Mint NFT** (Winner)
   - Navigate to `/owner`
   - Finalize and mint
   - Verify NFT creation
