# ZepoMint Integration Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to integrate your new ZepoMintFHEOptimized contract with the frontend after your wallet was hacked.

## 1. Problem Resolution

### Build Issue Fixed
- **Issue**: Duplicate exports in `fhe-wrapper.js` causing Vite build failure
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate function declarations for `encryptBidValue` and `getFHEInstance`

### New Contract Deployment
- **Issue**: Old contract and private key compromised
- **Solution**: Created and deployed new `ZepoMintFHEOptimized.sol` contract

## 2. Backend Changes

### New Contract
- Created `backend/contracts/ZepoMintFHEOptimized.sol`
- Maintains all FHE functionality of the previous contract
- Compatible with Zama FHEVM v0.8

### Deployment Scripts
- Created `deploy-zepamint-optimized.js` for basic deployment
- Created `initialize-zepamint-optimized.js` for contract initialization
- Created `verify-zepamint-optimized.js` for deployment verification
- Created `full-deployment-setup.js` for complete deployment process
- Created `set-public-key-uri.js` for public key configuration

### Documentation
- Created `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with step-by-step deployment instructions
- Created `DAPP_WORKFLOW.md` with complete workflow documentation

## 3. Frontend Integration

### Environment Updates
- Updated contract address in `frontend/app/.env`
- Updated contract address in `frontend/app/src/config/zama-config.js`
- Updated contract deployment info in `frontend/app/src/contract-deployment.json`

### ABI Integration
- Copied new ABI to `frontend/app/src/utils/ZepoMintFHEOptimized.json`
- Updated `contract-interaction.js` to use new ABI
- Fixed JSON import issues with proper import attributes

### Test Pages
- Created `ContractTest.jsx` page for contract connection testing
- Added route in `App.jsx` for contract test page
- Created `contract-test.html` for static testing
- Created verification utilities

### Documentation
- Created `FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md` with integration guide
- Created `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (this document)

## 4. Key File Locations

### Backend
- New Contract: `backend/contracts/ZepoMintFHEOptimized.sol`
- Deployment Scripts: `backend/scripts/`
- Deployment Info: `backend/deployments/zepamint-optimized-deployment.json`

### Frontend
- Environment Config: `frontend/app/.env`
- Contract ABI: `frontend/app/src/utils/ZepoMintFHEOptimized.json`
- Contract Interaction: `frontend/app/src/utils/contract-interaction.js`
- Test Page: `frontend/app/src/pages/ContractTest.jsx`

## 5. Testing the Integration

### Development Server
The development server is running at: http://localhost:5173/

### Test URLs
1. Contract Test: http://localhost:5173/contract-test
2. Environment Test: http://localhost:5173/env-test
3. Auctions Page: http://localhost:5173/auctions
4. Mint Page: http://localhost:5173/mint (for owner only)

### Verification Script
Run `frontend/app/src/utils/verify-frontend-integration.js` to verify integration

## 6. New Contract Address

Your new contract is deployed at:
```
0x0771aFDD5Ef859cDe4371dA1EafA62F07Ed2686a
```

This address has been automatically updated in all relevant configuration files.

## 7. Next Steps

### Verify Integration
1. Visit http://localhost:5173/contract-test
2. Check that all connection tests pass
3. Verify the contract address is correct

### Test Functionality
1. If you're the owner, try creating an auction at http://localhost:5173/mint
2. Test placing bids at http://localhost:5173/auctions
3. Verify all FHE encryption/decryption works correctly

### Update Public Key
If not already done, ensure the public key URI is set:
```bash
cd backend
npx hardhat run scripts/set-public-key-uri.js --network sepolia
```

## 8. Security Notes

### Private Key
- Your new private key is secure in `backend/.env`
- Never commit this file to version control
- Ensure proper file permissions

### FHE Security
- All bid encryption happens client-side
- Bid values remain encrypted throughout the process
- Winner selection uses secure FHE operations

## 9. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Contract Not Found**: Verify contract address in `.env` file
2. **ABI Mismatch**: Ensure using `ZepoMintFHEOptimized.json`
3. **Network Issues**: Check Sepolia testnet connection
4. **RPC Connection**: Verify RPC URLs in environment variables

### Debugging
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify environment variables are loaded
3. Test contract connection using the test page
4. Check Hardhat deployment logs

## 10. Maintenance

### Future Updates
If you deploy a new contract version:
1. Update contract address in `.env` file
2. Copy new ABI to `ZepoMintFHEOptimized.json`
3. Run integration verification
4. Test all functionality

This integration ensures your DApp works correctly with the new contract while maintaining all privacy-preserving features.
