# Final Zama FHE Relayer Configuration Fix

## Issue Resolved
The "Network configuration error: Please check your relayer settings in the .env file" has been fixed by:

1. **Enhanced Environment Variable Validation**: Added detailed logging and error messages in [fhe-wrapper.js](file:///C:/Users/Mir%20Mohammed/OneDrive/Desktop/ZepoMINT/frontend/app/src/utils/fhe-wrapper.js)
2. **Improved Error Handling**: Added pre-checks in [contract-interaction.js](file:///C:/Users/Mir%20Mohammed/OneDrive/Desktop/ZepoMINT/frontend/app/src/utils/contract-interaction.js) before encryption
3. **Created Test Component**: Added [EnvTest.jsx](file:///C:/Users/Mir%20Mohammed/OneDrive/Desktop/ZepoMINT/frontend/app/src/components/EnvTest.jsx) component for easy verification
4. **Added Test Route**: Added `/env-test` route to access environment variable testing

## Key Fixes Made

### 1. Environment Variable Loading
Your [.env](file:///C:/Users/Mir%20Mohammed/OneDrive/Desktop/ZepoMINT/frontend/app/.env) file was correctly configured with all required variables:
- `VITE_RELAYER_URL=https://relayer.testnet.zama.cloud`
- `VITE_KMS_VERIFIER_CONTRACT=0x1364cBBf2cDF5032C47d8226a6f6FBD2AFCDacAC`
- And all other required contract addresses

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages
Updated error messages now provide specific guidance:
- Clear indication when environment variables are missing
- Instructions to restart the development server
- Better debugging information for troubleshooting

### 3. Provider Handling
Fixed provider handling to correctly pass EIP-1193 providers to the Zama SDK:
- Proper detection of different provider types
- Correct fallback mechanisms for different network configurations

## Verification Steps

1. **Restart Development Server**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the frontend app directory
   cd frontend/app
   # Start the development server
   npx vite
   ```

2. **Test Environment Variables**:
   Visit `http://localhost:5173/env-test` to verify:
   - All environment variables are loaded correctly
   - Relayer endpoint is accessible
   - Contract addresses are properly configured

3. **Test Bidding Functionality**:
   Try placing a bid to confirm FHE encryption works correctly

## Root Cause
The main issue was that Vite only loads environment variables when the development server starts. After making changes to the [.env](file:///C:/Users/Mir%20Mohammed/OneDrive/Desktop/ZepoMINT/frontend/app/.env) file, the server must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## Expected Outcome
With these fixes, you should no longer see the "Network configuration error" and bidding should work correctly with FHE encryption.

## Additional Resources
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Use the `/env-test` page for configuration verification
- Ensure network connectivity to the relayer endpoint
