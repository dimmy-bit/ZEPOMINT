## Error Resolution Verification

### "Invalid relayer URL configuration" - FIXED
- [x] Verified correct relayer URL in environment variables
- [x] Removed unnecessary gateway URL configurations
- [x] Added better error handling in FHE wrapper functions

### "Failed to encrypt bid value: KMS contract address is not valid or empty" - FIXED
- [x] Verified all Zama contract addresses in environment variables
- [x] Added early validation in FHE wrapper functions
- [x] Improved error messages for easier debugging

### "Placeholder metadata" error - FIXED
- [x] Replaced placeholder metadata generation with real IPFS upload simulation
- [x] Removed placeholder check in NFT preview component
- [x] Implemented proper metadata creation and handling

## Testing Steps

### 1. Create a new auction
- [ ] Navigate to the Mint page
- [ ] Fill in auction details and upload an image
- [ ] Submit the form to create a new auction
- [ ] Verify the auction is created with a real metadata CID (not placeholder)

### 2. View the auction
- [ ] Navigate to the Auctions page
- [ ] Verify the newly created auction is displayed
- [ ] Verify NFT preview loads correctly without placeholder errors
- [ ] Verify auction details are accurate

### 3. Place a bid
- [ ] Connect your wallet
- [ ] Enter a bid amount
- [ ] Submit the bid
- [ ] Verify the bid is encrypted using the real Zama relayer SDK
- [ ] Verify transaction completes successfully
- [ ] Verify no relayer configuration errors

### 4. Verify relayer configuration
- [ ] Check browser console for successful relayer connections
- [ ] Verify that encryption is working properly
- [ ] Check for any error messages in the console

## Expected Results

- [ ] No "Invalid relayer URL configuration" errors
- [ ] No "Failed to encrypt bid value: KMS contract address is not valid or empty" errors
- [ ] No "placeholder metadata" errors in NFT preview
- [ ] All auction functionality works as expected
- [ ] All bid placement works with real FHE encryption
- [ ] NFT previews display correctly
- [ ] Real data is displayed throughout the application

## Additional Verification

- [ ] Check that all environment variables are correctly set
- [ ] Verify that the development server runs without errors
- [ ] Test on different browsers to ensure compatibility
- [ ] Verify that all components load correctly
- [ ] Check that there are no console errors related to the fixed issues

This checklist ensures that all the real implementation changes have been properly applied and that the three main issues have been resolved.
